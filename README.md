# Shell-go

## Project Abstract

### This project is a from-scratch implementation of a POSIX-compliant shell. It explores the inner workings of command-line interpreters â€” the programs responsible for executing commands, handling user input, and managing processes in Unix-like systems.

### Throughout the project, the shell evolves from printing a simple prompt to supporting a complete REPL with command parsing, built-in commands, quoting rules, I/O redirection, pipelines, history, and autocompletion.

- Key Features & Learning Milestones
- Command prompt and basic REPL loop
- Running external programs and handling invalid commands
- Built-in commands like cd, pwd, echo, and type
- Handling absolute, relative, and home directory navigation
- Single/double quotes and backslash parsing
- Standard output/error redirection and appending
- Command autocompletion including arguments and multiple matches
- Pipeline execution with built-ins and external commands
- Command history with in-memory and persistent storage

### I'm building this to deepen my understanding of Unix-like operating systems, process management, command parsing, and how real-world shells work under the hood.
